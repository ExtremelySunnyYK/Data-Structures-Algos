He has this unique ability to see and analyze the given project through different angles in a very short time and then implementing the most efficient and robust approach to bring the best out of it.
It was a great pleasure to have Long work with us angles Long has been a self-starter and an outstanding contributor to Matchinâ€™s development. Long is a perceptive, sharp, and quick individual with a high aptitude for programming and engineering. He is driven to understand how things work and he is one of those rare individuals who can both follow instructions, and take initiative when appropriate. He is responsible, resourceful, and someone who can be relied upon to deliver the results that we expect of him.
During his time at Matchin, Long was involved in working on a new initiative to improve the recommendation system. His contributions included surveying research papers to find new techniques, designing, validating and integrating new techniques to an open source framework and coming up with a presentation for his findings. His findings contributed significantly to the overall success of the project and allowed us to move forward, building on his deliverables.
