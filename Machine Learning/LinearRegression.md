# Linear Regression from Scatch

### Functions
- get_features :  split the data into training and test data sets

- split_data(train,test,random_state,split_ratio)

- normalize_z : normalize the feature using z normalization



### Evaluation
R2 score:
- When do we use R2?
- It is the correlation coefficient between the predicted values and the actual values.



MSE : 
- When do we use MSE?
- Sometimes when we use MSE, low MSE does not tell us if the model is good.
